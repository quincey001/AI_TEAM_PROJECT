## Sudoku Search Agent

The seach agent finds solutions for a given incomplete sudoku puzzle using Depth-first seach and Breadth-first search.
To solve sudoku puzzles using seach algorithms, go to SudokuSearchAgent directory, and simply run:

```bash
python main.py agent puzzle
```

replace **agent** with **dfs** to use DFS algorithm and with **bfs** to use BFS algorithm.
replace puzzle with the name of the puzzles exist in samples folder.

for example, the below command will run dfs agent for puzzle number 1:

```bash
python main.py dfs 1
<<<<<<< HEAD
```

```
