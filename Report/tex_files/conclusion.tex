\section{Conclusions}
In this paper, we investigated a set of AI algorithms to solve Sudoku puzzles. We introduced Sudoku and highlighted the essential constraints involved in the problem.  
We approached the problem with Backtracking as an enhanced version of classic Depth-fisrt search. We also solved Sudoku with constraint satisfaction using Pulp. We also trained a convolutional neural network using a one-million dataset. As the forth approach, we used genetic algorithm. 

We evaluated the results based on the time taken and memory used by each algorithm. We also compared the performance of each method against DFS algorithm as the baseline model. It was observed that all methods outperformed the baseline model. Constraint satisfaction solved every given puzzle in milliseconds and turned out to be the fastest and most efficient method to solve Sudoku puzzles. Backtracking algorithm however emerged as the most miserly in terms of memory consumption.
