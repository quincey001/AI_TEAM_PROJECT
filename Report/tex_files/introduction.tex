\section{Introduction}
Number games and grids like Sudoku have been around for hundreds of years but the modern game, as we know it today was originated by Howard Garns. Howardâ€™s first Sudoku puzzle was published in 1979 by Dell magazines and it was called Number Place but today we know it as Sudoku \cite{bib_madnumbers}. The famous Swiss mathematician, Leonhard Eular also wrote about similar concepts but the idea of these types of number games in general dates back ancient china \cite{bib_euler}.

From our experience, Sudoku games fall into two categories, they are either so easy which sometimes they become boring or they are too hard and we stop solving them. The motivation behind our research on Sudoku game is to find how well different algorithms can solve any Sudoku puzzles in few seconds. The objectives of our research are to compare and contrast the performance of these algorithms and examine which one is faster. Maybe there are some puzzles which takes minutes to be solved so we are going to discover such cases as well.

\subsection{The Rules of Sudoku}

The objective of the Sudoku game is to correctly fill in all the empty squares, in a grid of squares, with the correct numbers. As it was mentioned earlier, the classic Sudoku game involves a grid of 81 squares which are divided into 9 blocks, each block contains 9 squares. Each of the blocks, rows and columns must contain all the numbers from 1 through 9 within its squares without any duplicates.
