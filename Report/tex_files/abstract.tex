Sudoku puzzle is a classic problem in which missing digits are to be placed into a 9x9 grid of squares that are split into 3x3 boxes so that the numbers 1 through 9 appear only once in every row, column, and box. Although every Sudoku puzzle has solution, they involve different levels of hardship. In this paper, we introduce, implement and analyze some of the AI algorithms suitable including uniformed-search, genetic algorithms, constraint satisfaction and convolutional neural network to solve any given Sudoku puzzles. The results are compared with respect to the time taken and memory consumed by each algorithms.
