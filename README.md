## Sudoku Search Agent

The seach agent finds solutions for a given incomplete sudoku puzzle using Depth-first seach and Breadth-first search.
To solve sudoku puzzles using seach algorithms, go to SudokuSearchAgent directory, and simply run:

```bash
python main.py agent puzzle
```

replace agent with dfs to use DFS algorithm and with bfs to use BFS algorithm.
replace puzzle with the name of the puzzles exist in samples folder.

for example, the below command will run dfs agent for puzzle numer 1:

```bash
python main.py agent puzzle
```
