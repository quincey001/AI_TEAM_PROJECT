## Sudoku Genetic algorithm

genetic algorithm is a search heuristic method to solve the problem, self-discovery and make judgement quickly and efficiently. this algorithm is inspired by Darwinism, which is a biological evolution theory that all species arise through natural selection. A genetic algorithm generates a patch of generations with possible solutions for the research problem and selects the fittest individuals which are parents to reproduce the next child generation. Evaluate them to get the fittest children as the next parents to get the finalized best solution.
